This project was generated with C3 and [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.0.0.

And demonstrates how one can easily build and deploy fullstack web applications to Cloudflare.

The application is server-side rendered and deployed globally via [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com).

The whole Angular SSR + Cloudflare integration is still in early days, but is improving quickly. While the DX has a lot of room for improvement, the deployed code is on par with traditional Node.js-based Angular SSR setup.

Deployed at [https://ilovejavascript.net](https://ilovejavascript.net).

CHANGED!
